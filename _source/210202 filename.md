  This sample post shows you how to use multiple tags.
  And how to write longer summaries and footnotes.

How are you my friend? I'd like to show you some JavaScript[^1].

[^1]: Can you believe the invention of JavaScript has nothing to do with the written language of Java the island?

```javascript
var name = {hello: 'world'};

true ? "Of course":"You may want to reconsider."

const helloWorld = `Goodbye ${my} love.`
```

I'd also like to show you some Python.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("your_heart.txt", "r") as f:
        f.write("to try new things.")
```

Below is a horizontal ruler.

Meow. I also tried some right-to-left text. But by default it still converts it as if it's LTR. There must be a way to enable it. You may want to check out the documenation of [markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2).
